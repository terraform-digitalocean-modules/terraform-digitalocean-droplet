#Â Loadbalancer example

An example of provisioning Droplets attached to a Load Balancer using tags.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Now visit your Load Balancer IP in a browser and refresh. After a few minutes
you should see the requests are sent to each Droplet in a round-robin fashion.

**Note** that this example may create resources which can cost money.
Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
